### What is Connect?

Connect is a telegram bot that connects teachers and students. Students don't
want Teachers to get inside their groups, because students chat a lot of things
that would be improper for teachers to see. But it will make life a lot easier
if teachers can send files and text messages, to students that they are teaching
that semester without getting into student groups.

This is the problem that this bot solves. The teacher talks to this bot in a 
private chat. Students add this same bot to their groups. The teacher then 
pairs with a group he/she wants then the teacher can send whatever message 
he/she likes. And this message gets forwarded to the student group that the teacher
wants.
